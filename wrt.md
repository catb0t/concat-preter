 * late binding
 * much is done as strings (hashing and function objects)
 * unicode source & string literals
 * purely functional like Joy, concatenative and homoiconic
 * interop with C is almost free (varargs functions need arrays)

need to build:
 * interpreter / compiler executable target
 * libraries from src as .o objects  
 * libfnv.a and libconcat.a as archives of objects
